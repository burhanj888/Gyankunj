                        <p>The very first step for a child out home is in the form of preschool. At this age, children grow rapidly;
                            there is whole range of firsts which they do. From their first dance to their first trophy, 
                            the experience gained by our children during the preschool is of humongous significance. 
                            This is the reason why we have partnered with Dreams Achievers, leader in educational program and knowledge dissemination industry so as to understand the psyche of our children. 
                            This has allowed us to put everything in place which is required for a healthy, friendly and loving environment for our children to learn naturally while playing and enjoying the games they love.

                            it is found that children are fearless when it comes to learning and understanding about the world 
                            around them. Even though they don't know how to walk, they will keep trying until they can. Moreover, 
                            they are not afraid of falling, such fearlessness could be used to design activities that are fun and 
                            enjoyable for children and at the same time help them in understanding concepts and phenomenon.

                        <p>As far as education is concerned, there are primarily two methodologies of learning which are used widely. 
                            The first one is the passive learning methodology, which we all have gone through. This is a teacher 
                            centric methodology in which a teacher gives lectures in classrooms on black boards and child has to learn 
                            and remember what the teacher has told. On the other hand, the much less used methodology is the active 
                            learning methodology. Contrastingly, it is a child centric methodology where activities are designed in 
                            such a way that the child learns from doing rather than from just listening and seeing. The effectiveness 
                            of active learning approach has been proven scientifically.

                        <p>We understand the fact that for children everything happening around them is a game. 
                        This understanding allowed us to develop unique and innovative activities which turn each and every learning experience 
                        into a game for our children to learn more effectively and efficiently. Our learning activities are an amalgamation of 
                        fun and enjoyment with knowledge and physical growth. As both the physical as well as mental growth of our children is 
                        substantially rapid at this age, we need a mix of learning methodologies which focuses on both of these aspects so that 
                        our children are as well-equipped physically as they are mentally.

                        <p>The ability of children to learn naturally by using their five senses combined with their own experiences is a highly 
                            effective tool to help them learn efficiently. As the neurones in brains of our children become ever more powerful, 
                            they gain this natural sense of curiosity where they keep asking hundreds of questions. This insatiable thirst for knowledge 
                            is what distinguishes childhood from adulthood. Thus, the learning activities must be designed in such a way that the child can 
                            learn naturally by allowing him or her to experience different things and concepts in a game like environment.

                        <p style="margin-top: 16px;">Children learn and understand the world more effectively when they touch, see, hear, and play with objects.
                            This is the stage where motor skills start developing as children grow physically and mentally. 
                            Our approach comprises of activities like puzzles, games, parachute play, sand play, painting, drawing, 
                            and much more, which are designed using scientific techniques that help our children understand concepts 
                            while becoming aware of their motor skills. In today's age of information and globalisation, 
                            "change" is the only constant thing. Such a volatile international environment requires India to turn itself 
                            into a stronger force than ever. This can only happen when our children are allowed to realise their potential 
                            by providing the right education. Our purpose of education is to make them future-ready so that they can maximise 
                            the opportunities that will exist in the upcoming future.
